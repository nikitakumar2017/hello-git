1. We have created a repository on github and we want to clone it in our system, so we use the clone command-
 git clone <url of repository copied from github>

2. After doing some changes in a file, we want to put the file in a repository on github we use the following commands-
 i. To add the file in the staged area use command- 
    git add -A
 ii. To save our file from staged area onto git's local database use command-
    git commit -m "<message>"
 iii.Now, to push the file onto GITHUB Server use command-
     git push -u origin master
 iv. To check the status of our file use command-
    git status

3. The commands that are used to tell git our username and password of github are-
 i. git config --global user.name "<username>"
 ii. git config --global user.email "<email>"

The 3rd commands are to be run only 1 time.
